                        Have you ever had that moment where you stare at your screen, just trying to think of a good
                        headline for your email, website or product... but nothing really happens? Wouldn’t it be great
                        to just skip that?

                        This book was initially a Google Spreadsheet we (Gijs and Danny) created for our own projects.
                        We were sick and tired of those days we kept looking at a blank screen, unable to come up with
                        any headlines, titles or subject lines.

                        We a/b tested the new headlines on the websites of our clients and got amazing results. Some
                        headlines even doubled the initial conversion rates!

                        Quickly, word spread around town, and a few co-workers asked us if we could share this “secret”
                        collection of converting headlines with them. We did. They tested some of our headlines and saw some
                        <span>very positive</span> results with these headlines as well.
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        They were blown away by the massive impact a headline could make. This success inspired us to share
                        our
                        collection of <span>200 headlines</span> with everyone.
